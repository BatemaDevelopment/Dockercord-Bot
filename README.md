You will need to supply your own Discord Bot Token (found at https://discord.com/developers/), Client ID (found once you create a Discord Application), and Guild ID (found when you enable Developer Mode in Discord Settings in the Main Client, then copy your server, which is also known as a guild, ID). Other than that, this Dockerfile is usable OOTB (out of the box).
